# 🎮 Computer Graphics Games (C++ / OpenGL)


A collection of three 2D games built with C++ and OpenGL/GLUT, demonstrating essential computer graphics concepts such as shape rendering, animation, user interaction, and collision detection. All visual elements are created and rendered using OpenGL primitives without relying on external assets.
